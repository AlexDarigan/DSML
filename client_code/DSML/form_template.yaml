        \ six new attributes on my dataframe, a boolean for each possible color and\
        \ apply a function against each card's color list, six times (one per color).\
        \ Colorless  values are not stored in the list but as they represent the lack\
        \ of any color, we can decide if something is colorless if it has an empty\
        \ color list.\n```\ndf[\"red\"] = df[\"colors\"].apply(lambda x: type(x) is\

        \ x: type(x) is list and len(x) == 0)\n```\n&nbsp;\nOne project related to\
        \ this data is to follow the price trends of certain cards (and predict further\
        \ trends based on correlative data). One piece of correlated data is which\
        \ tournament types that cards are legal to use, however there are formats\
        \ that are various formats but only the following seem to make an impact on\
        \ a card's value.\n```\ndf[\"standard\"] = df[\"legalities.standard\"] ==\
        \ \"legal\"\ndf[\"modern\"] = df[\"legalities.modern\"] == \"legal\"\ndf[\"\
        vintage\"] = df[\"legalities.vintage\"] == \"legal\"\ndf[\"legacy\"] = df[\"\
        legalities.legacy\"] == \"legal\"\n```\n\n&nbsp;\nWe extract the regular $\
        \ and \u20ac price and their foiled equivelants (foiled referring to the card\
        \ having a foil finish). Some cards don't seem to have prices, likely due\
        \ to being so common that they aren't for sale at all, so for those we just\
        \ default them to a float of 0.0\n```\ndf[\"usd\"] = pd.to_numeric(df[\"prices.usd\"\
        ], errors='coerce').fillna(0.0)\ndf[\"usd_foil\"] = pd.to_numeric(df[\"prices.usd_foil\"\

        ], errors='coerce').fillna(0.0)\n```\n&nbsp;\nSome cards are double-sided\
        \ which means each set of attributes are doubled with a different set of values.\
        \ We filtered them out based on the presence of \"//\" in their name string\
        \ which indicated two names (e.g \" name 1 // name 2\"). This filtered dropped\
        \ about 800 cards out of 80,000 so the effect on any trend data should be\
        \ minimal.\n```\nfilter = df.name.apply(lambda x: \"//\" not in x)\ndf = df[filter]\n\
        ```\n&nbsp;\nFinally, after we have performed our necessary conversions and\
        \ extracts, one final extraction is performed, reducing the original [85~\
        \ columns](https://scryfall.com/docs/api/cards) down to 34 columns. This is\
        \ the data that ends up stored.\n```\ncardtable = pd.DataFrame(data=df, columns=[\"\
